Ruby HL7 Library 
================

Overview
========

Ruby [HL7](http://www.hl7.org) is a simple library which parses and creates version 2.x messages based upon the work of [Mark Guzman](https://github.com/segfault/ruby-hl7).  To prevent version collision with other forks and provide the ability to download the gem from rubygems, I am considering renaming the project.

Getting Started
===============

For now, to add this gem to your application, simply link to github by adding this to your Gemfile:

* gem 'ruby-hl7', '~> 0.5.0', git: 'git://github.com/randysecrist/ruby-hl7.git'

Issues & Feedback
=================

There are many variations in how HL7 is interpeted by payers and providers.  Have an issue or creative itch?  Please get in touch.
